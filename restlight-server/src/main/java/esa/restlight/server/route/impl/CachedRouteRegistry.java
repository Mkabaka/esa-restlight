/**
 * Implementation of RouteRegistry.
 * <p>
 * As different as {@link SimpleRouteRegistry}, this implementation uses a cache of the Route to speed up the url
 * routing. The algorithm used in {@link CachedRouteRegistry} is same with the LFU(Least Frequently Used), but we do not
 * update the cache immediately when the element is accessed, instead, we update it in a certain probability(default to
 * 0.1 percent).
